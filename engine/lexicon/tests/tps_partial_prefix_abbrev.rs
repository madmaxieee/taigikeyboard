//! Regression: TPS continuous partial-prefix must surface single-char
//! readings for a single-initial input (e.g. `ㄍ`), not only multi-
//! syllable phrases (user-reported 2026-06-15: typing `ㄍ` showed only
//! multi-syllable words, starting at 姑不將).
//!
//! Root cause (now fixed): the FST wire separator `0xFF` is greater than
//! any UTF-8 byte, so a short exact key (`tps:ㄍㄚ` = 家/ka) byte-sorts
//! AFTER all its longer extensions (`tps:ㄍㄚㄅㄧ`…). A plain byte-ordered
//! `lookup_prefix(..).take(cap)` front-loaded the longest (rarest) words
//! and buried the short high-frequency single-syllable readings past the
//! `PARTIAL_PREFIX_HYDRATE_CAP`. The fix spends the hydrate budget on the
//! SHORTEST matched keys first via `PrefixIndex::lookup_prefix_shortest_first`
//! (all modes); the downstream `CandidateSortKey` then ranks the pool by frequency.
//! The initial-only `tps_abbrev` acronym keys (Bopomofo orders all initials
//! ahead of all vowels, so they would otherwise win the shortest-first
//! budget) live in their own `tps-abbrev:` family since §46 and never enter
//! a `tps:` scan.
