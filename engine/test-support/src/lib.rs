//! Helpers shared by the engine crates' integration tests (dev-dependency
//! only): temp files, the `dictionary.fst` / `dictionary.bin` /
//! `association.bin` fixture serializers, the per-binary install lock, and
//! the production artifacts (`assets/dictionaries/`, `dictionary/output/
//! dictionary.csv`).
//!
//! Only crate-neutral helpers live here. Anything that needs an engine type
//! (`lexicon::LexiconPaths`, composing requests) stays in that crate's
//! `tests/common/mod.rs`.
